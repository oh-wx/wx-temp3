* HEAT INDEX VALUES...Around 100 today, and near or above 105
  Friday and Saturday due to temperatures in the mid 90s, and
  dewpoints in the mid 70s.

* TIMING...This afternoon through Saturday evening. Very little

  falling into the middle and upper 70s.

* IMPACTS...Heat stroke, heat exhaustion and other heat related
  illnesses will be possible, especially if you spend a
  significant amount of time outdoors, or are involved in any
  strenuous outdoor activity. The cumulative impacts of heat on
  the human body can be significant when consecutive days of
  excessive heat occur.

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

Wear light weight and loose fitting clothing and drink plenty of
water. If possible, spend more time in air conditioned or well-
ventilated places. Reschedule strenuous outdoor activities to
early morning or evening. Friends, relatives, or neighbors should
check on the elderly and people with chronic ailments, who are
usually the first to suffer from heat-related illness.

Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks
in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by
