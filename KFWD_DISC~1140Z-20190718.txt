.AVIATION...
/12Z TAFs/

Concerns -- Brief MVFR possible at KACT thru 15Z. VFR/S flow
otherwise.

High pressure will remain in control of the region`s weather thru
the TAF period. At present time...GOES-16 "Night Fog" product and
surface obs show patchy MVFR stratus infiltrating parts of Central
TX. KACT has not yet reported any MVFR cigs...thus "upgraded" the
previous TAF from prevailing to TEMPO MVFR. Beyond 15Z...KACT
should become VFR...joining the rest of our TAF sites.
Otherwise...look for breezy southerly winds (10-15 kt, with gusts
to around 20 kt possible) and little to no cloud cover.

.SHORT TERM... /Issued 259 AM CDT Thu Jul 18 2019/
/Today and Tonight/

Another hot day in store for North and Central Texas, but with
slightly breezier conditions, and lower humidity, heat index
values will not be as oppressive as the past few days. Look for
another mostly sunny, rain-free day.

Texas remains under the influence of a stout upper-level ridge
this morning, with 500 mb heights around 594 dam on the 00Z RAOB.
Farther away across the Northern Rockies, an impressive 130+ kt
jet streak will overspread the region, with a shortwave trough
expected to propagate along the International Border. This
combination will induce pressure falls across the Rocky Mountains,
which will in turn result in strengthening poleward flow across
the Great Plains. The enhanced south winds this afternoon combined
with strong insolation will result in deep boundary layer mixing,
thus helping to dry out the lower levels of the troposphere. The
final result of all this will mean dewpoint temperatures dropping
into the mid 60s across much of North Texas (unfortunately, parts
of Central and East Texas will still see dewpoints in the upper
60s to near 70). Because of these lower humidity values, heat
index values should top out near 100 F, which while still plenty
hot enough to warrant the usual precautions, will be low enough to
preclude the issuance of a Heat Advisory. It should be stressed
however, that it will still be hot enough that folks will need to
take the usual precautions to avoid heat-related illness.

Thursday Night will be much like the past several nights,
featuring low temperatures in the mid 70s across most of the
county warning area, except for the urban core of the Dallas/Fort
Worth Metropolitan Area where lows will bottom out in the upper
70s.

.LONG TERM... /Issued 259 AM CDT Thu Jul 18 2019/
/Friday through Next Week/

The extended forecast maintains the idea of a synoptic-scale
pattern shift across the Lower 48 starting late this weekend into
early next week. The finer details of how this will impact North
and Central Texas are yet to be resolved, but the TL;DR summary (TL;DR
stands for "too long; didn`t read" -- I`m hip. I`m with it.) is
that temperatures should gradually cool some next Tuesday and
Wednesday, along with an uptick in rain and storm chances.

Until then, elongated mid-level ridging across the southern 2/3rds
of the contiguous US will relegate stronger zonal flow to
locations closer to the International Border. This stronger flow
will maintain lee troughing across the central/northern High
Plains, keeping us with a modest low-level jet through the
weekend and breezy southerly winds each day as diurnal mixing
ensues. Plentiful insolation and progressively deeper mixing each
afternoon should maintain highs in the mid/upper 90s through the
weekend. A few spots may still touch 100 degrees, but the deeper
mixing may shave a few more degrees off afternoon dew points,
keeping heat indices in the 100-105 range.

By late Sunday into Monday, the northern stream becomes more
interesting as a mid-level ridge strengthens over the Inter-
Mountain West and a jet streak crests this ridge, dropping
southeast over the northern Plains. In combination with weak
impulses rounding the western periphery of a Hudson Bay low, this
jet streak and related vort max will carve out a broader-scale
trough across the eastern US during the first half of next week.
The extent to which it does will determine how quickly a front and
rain chances invade North and Central Texas Monday through
Wednesday. The GFS has been rather consistent with driving this
system southeast across the Missouri Valley, creating more robust
northerly flow across the Plains and pushing a surface front and
some convection through our area rather quickly on Monday. This
evolution would create rather pleasant conditions for Tuesday (by
late July standards), with many locations in the 80s under a dry
northeast breeze. This amplified of a scenario still seems
somewhat dubious, though, given climatology and multi-model
spread.

A more likely scenario is that the aforementioned systems
initially drive a cold front into the Central Plains, Ozarks, and
mid Mississippi Valley, and then convective influences (e.g.,
feedback into the mid-level pattern, outflow, etc.) cause an
effective front to ooze southward through our area Tuesday into
Tuesday night. This evolution would result in a hot and dry
Monday, followed by increasing rain/storm chances and cooler
temperatures on Tuesday and Wednesday, thanks to cloud cover and
precipitation. The extended forecast generally reflects this
thinking, although PoPs are not particularly high for any one
period, given continued uncertainty regarding timing. Still,
at least a brief period of below-normal high temps is appearing
more likely next week.
